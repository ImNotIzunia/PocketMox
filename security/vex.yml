      status: "not_affected"
      justification: |
        BusyBox is present as a system dependency in the container:
        - Installed binary: /usr/bin/busybox
        - Version: 1:1.37.0-6+b3
        - Evidence from container:
          - grep busybox: only mkinitramfs references
          - busybox | grep cpio: cpio applet exists but is not called
          - which cpio: /usr/bin/cpio (GNU cpio used, not Busybox)
          - systemctl list-unit-files | grep cpio: no services using cpio
        Exploitation would require prior privileged shell access (already root), providing no security impact
